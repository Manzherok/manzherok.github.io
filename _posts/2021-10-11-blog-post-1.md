Paracompact Spaces
==================
The idea of a *paracompactness* is somewhat a variation of *compactness*. Namely, it is yet another statement about what type of subcover may be extracted from an open cover of a given topological space. Recall, for a topological space $(X, \tau)$,

- $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a **Lindel√∂f space** if every open cover of $X$ has a *countable* subcover.
- $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a **compact space** if every open cover of $X$ has a *finite* subcover.

To clarify, by an *open cover* of $X$, we mean an arbitrary collection $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of open sets such that 
$$X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha.$$
So, a *subcover* of $\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is simply a collection $\{U_{\beta}\}_{\beta \in B}$ with $B \subseteq A$.
