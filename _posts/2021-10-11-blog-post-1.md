Paracompact Spaces
==================
The idea of a *paracompactness* is somewhat a variation of *compactness*. Namely, it is yet another statement about what type of subcover may be extracted from an open cover of a given topological space. Recall, for a topological space $X$,

- $X$ is said to be a **Lindel√∂f space** if every open cover of $X$ has a *countable* subcover.
- $X$ is said to be a **compact space** if every open cover of $X$ has a *finite* subcover.

To clarify, by an *open cover* of $X$, we mean an arbitrary collection $\mathfrak{U} = (U_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ of open sets such that 
$$X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha.$$

So, a *subcover* of $\mathfrak{U}$ is simply a collection $(U_\beta)_{\beta \in B}$ with $B \subseteq A$.

Before getting to the main definition, let's introduce some new terms. Let $X$ be a topological space, $\mathfrak{U}$ some open cover of $X$, and $\mathfrak{V}$ some collection of subsets of $X$.
1. Another open cover $\widetilde{\mathfrak{U}}$ of $X$ is a **refinement** of $\mathfrak{U}$ if for all $\widetilde{U} \in \widetilde{\mathfrak{U}}$ there exists a $U \in \mathfrak{U}$ such that $\widetilde{U} \subseteq U$. 
2. $\mathfrak{V}$ is **locally finite** if for all $p \in X$, there exists some open set $U$ containing $p$ such that $$U \cap V \neq \emptyset \qquad \text{for only finitely many } V \in \mathfrak{V}.$$
